Test Case 1: Test with SIGPIPE

This test case tests the server's ability to handle with SIGPIPE. In this
test case, the client close the connection right before the server calls
send() to send data back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Run lisod inside gdb, before running, set a breakpoint at function io_send.
2. Use netcat to send arbitrary data to Liso server.
3. At this point, the breakpoint should be hit. Without continueing lisod,
   terminate netcat.
4. Continue running lisod and it will try to send data to an already closed
   socket and a SIGPIPE will be generated. See if the server terminates when
   receiving SIGPIPE.
