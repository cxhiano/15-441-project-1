Test Case 1: Test with SIGPIPE

Description: This test case tests the server's ability to handle with SIGPIPE.
In this test case, the client close the connection right before the server
calls send() to send data back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Run lisod inside gdb, before running, set a breakpoint at function io_send.
2. Use netcat to send arbitrary data to Liso server.
3. At this point, the breakpoint should be hit. Without continueing lisod,
   terminate netcat.
4. Continue running lisod and it will try to send data to an already closed
   socket and a SIGPIPE will be generated. See if the server terminates when
   receiving SIGPIPE.

Test Case 2: Test with Large Data

Decription: Send very large data to server. Observe buffer shrinking behavior
*******************************************************************************

Test Case 3: Test Linked list

Decription: The server uses linked list to maintain client sockets, the purpose
of this test case is to see whether the linked list operate correctly. In
linked_list_checker.py, the client establishes serveral connections to the
server and closes those connections in random order.
